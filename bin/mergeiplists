# ----------------------------------------

# How does this work?

# In general, we prepend each line with the IP address, tell sort to
# remove any duplicates (but only have sort look at the prepended
# text), then we remove the prepended text.  Cute, eh?

# In specific:

# cat $*   --- cat all the files given as input.  If none, stdin is assumed.

# perl -ne '...' --- Pass the input through this perl program.  Yes,
# you can include an entire perl program right on the command line.
# In shell, a ' or " can start a string that continues for multiple
# lines.
# The problem is that since we use a single quote, the entire program
# can't use the single quote... unless we escape it with a backlash.
# This makes it difficult to read, which limits this to only be usable
# for short perl programs.
# This is a better technique for awk programs, since awk rarely
# uses the single quote.  (Most likely to make this technique work
# so well.)

# The perl code ---  This files the first IP address on a line, and
# appends it to the start of the line followed by a "tab" then the
# original line.
# If there is no IP address on the line, it prepends the entire line.
# We aren't really finding the "first IP address".  We're a bit
# sloppy and just skipping over any comments, then if the next chars
# are a sequence of digits and periods we assume that's an IP address
# (no matter how long the sequence is.)

# sort -t"\t" -u -k1,1   --- This sets the separator to TAB, uniques
# the input (removes any duplicate lines), and sets the key to be
# the first field only ("1,1" means "from the first to the first
# field").
# Note that "-u" defines "unique" as a comparison of fields being
# compared for the rest of the sort.  Thus is doesn't matter if the
# rest of the line is different, only the first field is looked at
# for determining uniqueness.  Many software systems have had major
# bugs because someone didn't know this.  (Imagine sorting a list
# based on the third field and being surprised when half of your
# lines disappeared!)

# sortbyip  --- now sort the list by IP address.

# cut -f2-  --- removes the bit of info we attached to the
# front of each line.
