RELEASE HISTORY:

pre-1.0 -- many internal releases
1.0 -- Licensed under GPL and released externally


TODO:

Better host-down handling:
	If a host is down, the system waits too long to time out.
We could add a "ping host &&" to the front of the statement but we
have to do it in a way such that the datestamp files aren't touched.
Otherwise, when the host comes back up, it will not get the update.
